# HR Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort between Ashik Chandra Das and Qazi Novera. We collected HR data from a company in America, which was sourced from Kaggle. Our goal was to uncover important insights from the data through classification and visualization techniques.

## Key Findings
No Discrimination Based on Ethnicity: Our analysis confirmed that there was no discrimination based on ethnicity within the company.

Gender Disparity in Average Salary: We observed that the majority of the employees were women, and on average, they tended to earn more than their male counterparts.

No Clear Relationship with Termination: Despite analyzing various factors such as performance score and job satisfaction, we found no significant relationship with employee termination.

Accurate Salary Prediction: Using machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, we were able to accurately predict employee salaries based on various parameters.

## Technologies Used
Python Libraries: We utilized various Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis, including Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for creating visualizations to better understand the data and present our findings effectively.

Machine Learning Model: Random Forest algorithm was employed for salary prediction, one of the key tasks in the project.

## Collaboration
This project was a joint effort between Ashik Chandra Das and Qazi Novera. Both team members contributed equally to the data analysis, model building, and visualization tasks.

## Repository Structure
Data: Contains the HR data collected from the company, sourced from Kaggle.

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, key findings, technologies used, collaboration details, and repository structure.

## Future Work
While this project provided valuable insights into the HR data, there are several avenues for future exploration. This includes delving deeper into factors influencing employee termination, conducting more sophisticated machine learning analyses, and exploring additional datasets to gain a more comprehensive understanding of HR dynamics.
